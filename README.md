This course introduces the concepts of relational and non-relational database structures from a software developer perspective. Topics include defining key/value pairs, building table structures, manipulating records, using data types, and implementing access controls. The Structured Query Language (SQL) will be used to manipulate the models. Students will prepare a small application using a relational database management system.
